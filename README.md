# Hi there, I'm Christer!👋
I currently work as a System Manager at Fjord1 AS, where I manage, develop, and maintain our support systems. Developing websites has always been a personal passion, and I recently completed a Front-End Development program at Noroff Vocational School, officially solidifyinf mt skills and turning my long-time hobby into a professional qualification.
